## 1. Rollout Local Engineering Environment

```
# Start Local Engineering Environment
$ vagrant up

# Provision Nginx Example
$ ansible-playbook tasks/11.yml -i inventory03 -v

# Provision Tomcat (from YUM Repo) Example
$ ansible-playbook tasks/12.yml -i inventory03 -v

# Provision Tomcat (from SRC) Example
$ ansible-playbook tasks/13.yml -i inventory03 -v

# Stop VM
$ vagrant halt

# Destroy VM
$ vagrant destroy -f
```

## 2. Inventory File
Ansible works against multiple systems in your infrastructure at the same time. It does this by selecting portions of systems listed in Ansibleâ€™s inventory, which defaults to being saved in the location /etc/ansible/hosts. You can specify a different inventory file using the -i <path> option on the command line.

[Ansible Documentation](http://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/intro_inventory.html)

### 2.1. [inventory01](inventory01)
> Simplest configuration.
> We need to pass all connection settings in ansible-playbook command-line arguments

```
$ ansible-playbook playbook -i inventory01 -c paramiko -u vagrant --ask-pass
$ ansible-playbook playbook -i inventory01 -c paramiko -u vagrant --private-key=~/.vagrant.d/insecure_private_key
```

### 2.2. [inventory02](inventory02)
> Added connection settings, ansible-playbook command gets simpler

```
$ ansible-playbook playbook -i inventory02
```

### 2.3. [inventory03](inventory03)
> Added aliases to actual hosts, it could help with troubleshooting

```
$ ansible-playbook playbook -i inventory03
```

## 3. Sample Playbooks

1. Deploying [Nginx](tasks/11.yml) + Sanity Tests
2. Deploying [Tomcat (yum repo)](tasks/12.yml) + Sanity Tests
3. Deploying [Tomcat (from sources)](tasks/13.yml) + Sanity Tests

## 4. Ansible [Configuration File](ansible.cfg)
Certain settings in Ansible are adjustable via a configuration file.
[Here](ansible.cfg)'s a basic (widely used) settings. Complete list of possible settings can be found [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ansible/ansible/devel/examples/ansible.cfg)

1. [Disabling SSH key host checking](ansible.cfg#L4)
2. [Displaying module arguments into stdout](ansible.cfg#L15)
3. [Disabling creating *.retry files](ansible.cfg#L21)
